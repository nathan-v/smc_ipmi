# smc_ipmi Telegraf input plugin
Python script to parse the output of [SMCIPMITool](https://www.supermicro.com/en/solutions/management-software/ipmi-utilities) into the [InfluxDB line protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/reference/syntax/line-protocol/). Intended to be run via Telegraf's [exec](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/exec) input plugin.

## Requirements
The SMCIPMITool [[download]](https://www.supermicro.com/SwDownload/SwSelect_Free.aspx?cat=IPMI) must be installed on the Telegraf host.

## Install
Clone this repo to the Telegraf host and configure Telegraf as shown below.

## Configuration

`/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`
```
[[inputs.exec]]
   commands = ["/path/to/smc_ipmi.py /path/to/SCMIPMITool '192.168.1.2' 'ipmi_user' 'ipmi_pw' 'F'"]

   data_format = "influx"
   
   timeout = "9s" # Optional: This keeps the system from waiting up to 30s for metrics

  # Optional: This will add a hostname tag rather than referencing the metrics by IP.
  [inputs.exec.tags]
    hostname = "myhostname"
```

## Usage
